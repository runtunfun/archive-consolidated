# Best Practices

In this guide, we will outline a set of best practices for software development, focusing on key design principles to ensure efficient and organized collaboration using Git and GitHub. These principles include:

## KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

   The KISS principle advocates for simplicity in design and implementation. It suggests that systems work best when they are kept simple rather than complex. This approach enhances clarity, ease of maintenance, and reduces the likelihood of errors. Strive for minimalism in code, architecture, and design.

## Git Workflow

   Git is the chosen version control system for managing source code. Employ a well-defined Git workflow to streamline collaboration and version tracking:

- **Branching Model**: Utilize a branching strategy like Gitflow, where feature branches are created for new features, bugfix branches for addressing issues, develop branch for ongoing development, and master/main branch for stable releases.
- **Pull Requests (PRs)**: Encourage the use of PRs for code review and collaboration. PRs allow team members to discuss changes, catch bugs early, and maintain code quality.

- **Code Reviews**: Mandate code reviews to ensure high-quality code and knowledge sharing within the team. Address feedback and concerns before merging.

## Semantic Versioning

   Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a versioning scheme that follows a predictable pattern (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to communicate the nature of changes in a release:

- **MAJOR**: Increment when there are backward-incompatible changes.
- **MINOR**: Increment for backward-compatible additions or improvements.
- **PATCH**: Increment for backward-compatible bug fixes.

## Commit Messages and Automatic Versioning

   Commit messages play a crucial role in tracking changes and understanding the evolution of your codebase. When using an automatic versioning tool, such as semantic-release, link commit messages to version updates:

- **Conventional Commits**: Follow a convention for commit messages, such as Angular's format (feat: add new feature, fix: resolve bug, chore: routine tasks, etc.).

- **Version Automation**: Integrate a tool like semantic-release to analyze commit history and automatically determine appropriate version bumps based on commit messages.

## GitHub for Collaboration

   GitHub provides a platform for effective collaboration, issue tracking, and version control. Here's how to maximize its benefits:

- **Repository Structure**: Organize your repository with clear directory structures for source code, documentation, tests, and more.
- **Issues and Milestones**: Use GitHub Issues to track tasks, bugs, and enhancements. Assign them to milestones for better project planning.
- **Project Boards**: Create project boards to visualize tasks, prioritize work, and track progress using Kanban-style boards.
- **Automation with Actions**: Leverage GitHub Actions for automating routine tasks such as building, testing, and deployment. Link these actions to your versioning tool for automated version updates.
