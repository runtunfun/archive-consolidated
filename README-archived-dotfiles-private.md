# dotfiles

Using yadm to manage my dotfiles.

## Install Fonts in Windows for WSL II (optional)

[Meslo Nerd Font patched for Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#fonts)

## Minimal requirements in Linux (WSL II)
`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get upgrade`

`sudo apt-get install curl git wget yadm`

## Setup

scripts/setup_zsh.sh

## Notes
Note that these are my settings and decrypting the secret yadm keys require my gpg password so it probably will not work for you :)
the last sentence was stolen from [bjartek](https://github.com/bjartek/dotfiles)
